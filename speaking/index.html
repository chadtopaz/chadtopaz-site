              <p>This is not a social justice talk, and the latter part of it is very technical. However, the first 10 minutes are not technical, and will give you a good sense of my speaking style and the audience reaction.</p>

          <h2>Testimonials</h2>

          <div class="testimonial-card">
            <p class="testimonial-quote">To catalyze Berkeley Lab's thinking and planning around incorporating equity data into research, we Chad brought in Chad to facilitate a virtual seminar. We were interested in introducing the Lab community to QSIDE, and learning more about their research, methodology, and impact. Chad also facilitated a lively discussion around some DEI challenges within our organization, and ideas to further our impact in this space. Chad has an effective presentation style, using simple, beautiful slides, and incorporating a storyline with compelling research examples showcasing the nationally- and internationally-acclaimed research. We received unsolicited glowing feedback from Lab colleagues, including those on our leadership team. It was a treat for us to see a brilliant researcher and impactful public speaker in one package. Chad's seminar prompted the idea of an organization-wide working group to share successes, best practices, and lessons learned regarding data equity in ongoing and future research. Finally, Chad cares about the outcome of the seminar, and is extremely diligent – he reached out of his own accord before the talk to ensure he understood what our event was about, the purpose, the role of his presentation, and what impact the organizers wanted to have – and he hand-crafted his presentation based on this discussion. Overall, an extremely positive experience.</p>

          <div class="testimonial-card">
            <p class="testimonial-quote">Chad's lecturing style is immediately engaging the moment you enter the room. He is one of the few speakers I have seen who greets everyone as they arrive and forms a relationship with the audience so that you feel that he is having a conversation with you individually, not just lecturing to a large group of anonymous people. All of Chad's talks were very well received by the audiences, which included faculty from across science disciplines, postgraduate and undergraduate students. Both myself and other faculty members have adapted our teaching styles to incorporate many of Chad's suggestions and ideas.</p>

          <div class="testimonial-card">
            <p class="testimonial-quote">You may ask yourself what mathematics has to do with social justice? Much more than you imagined. Everything, in fact, as Prof Topaz convinced his audience in his highly compelling talk on several urgent issues. Prof Topaz' passionate talk generated a lot of interest and great discussions…despite the fact that the talk and discussion were online because of the pandemic situation. His elegant and easily accessible explanations of the complexities of mathematics inspired us all to dive deeper into the subject.</p>
            <p class="testimonial-attribution">Prof. Frithjof Lutscher, University of Ottawa</p>
          </div>

          <div class="testimonial-card">
            <p class="testimonial-quote">Chad is a dynamic and passionate speaker on issues of social justice. He brings a creative approach combining statistics and crowd sourcing to explore questions of equity and justice in a wide range of areas. In order to call out injustice and then take action, Chad argues for the use of readily available mathematical tools. Our audience connected with what Chad has to say, but students particularly found his approach eye-opening and inspiring.</p>
